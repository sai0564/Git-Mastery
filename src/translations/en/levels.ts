        `🔄 **Understanding git reset --soft**

**The Situation:**
You're working on a feature and made 5 commits. But looking back, you realize:
- Commit 5: "Add database config" - Oops! This has sensitive credentials! 🔐
- Commit 4: "Update API endpoints" - This is good ✅
- Commit 3: "Add authentication" - Good ✅
- Commit 2: "Setup routing" - Good ✅
- Commit 1: "Initial project setup" - Good ✅

You need to undo commit 5, fix it, and commit again properly!

**What is git reset --soft?**
Think of Git commits like a stack of boxes 📦📦📦. Each box is a commit.

\`git reset --soft\` removes boxes from the top of the stack, BUT keeps all the items (your changes) on a staging table, ready to be packed into a new box!

**Three Ways to Use git reset --soft:**

**1. Reset to the previous commit (most common):**
\`git reset --soft HEAD~1\`
- HEAD = "where you are now" (the top box)
- ~1 = "go back 1 box"
- Result: Last commit removed, but changes stay staged!

**2. Reset to HEAD (educational - does nothing):**
\`git reset --soft HEAD\`
- This means "reset to where I already am"
- Nothing happens! Good for understanding the concept.

**3. Reset to an older commit:**
\`git reset --soft HEAD~3\`
- Goes back 3 commits
- All changes from those 3 commits stay staged
- Perfect for combining multiple commits into one!

**Your Mission:**

**Step 1:** Remove the last commit (the one with credentials)
\`git reset --soft HEAD~1\`
Check with \`git status\` - your files are still staged! ✨

**Step 2:** Try resetting to HEAD (educational)
\`git reset --soft HEAD\`
Notice: Nothing changed! You're already at HEAD.

**Step 3:** Go back further to practice
\`git reset --soft HEAD~2\`
Now you've removed 2 commits, but files are still staged!

**Remember:**
- 📦 Commits are removed from history
- ✅ Files stay in staging area
- 🎯 Perfect for fixing commit messages or combining commits
- ⚠️  Only use on commits you haven't pushed yet!

Let's practice these three techniques! 🚀`,

**The Situation:**
It's Friday evening. You've been experimenting with a new feature all day:
- Commit 6: "Try experimental algorithm v3" - Completely broken! 💀
- Commit 5: "Try experimental algorithm v2" - Still broken! 🐛
- Commit 4: "Try experimental algorithm v1" - Nope! ❌
- Commit 3: "Add user dashboard" - This was working! ✅
- Commit 2: "Add user authentication" - Good ✅
- Commit 1: "Initial project" - Good ✅

You realize: These experiments are garbage. You want them GONE. Forever. 💣

**What is git reset --hard?**
Remember the boxes metaphor? 📦📦📦

\`git reset --soft\` removed boxes but kept the items on the staging table.

\`git reset --hard\` removes boxes AND throws all items in the trash! 🗑️

**⚠️  CRITICAL: This is DESTRUCTIVE and PERMANENT!**
- Commits are deleted from history
- ALL file changes are deleted
- Working directory is cleaned
- Staging area is cleared
- **THERE IS NO UNDO!**

**Three Ways to Use git reset --hard:**

**1. Destroy the last commit (most common):**
\`git reset --hard HEAD~1\`
- Removes the last commit
- Deletes all changes in that commit
- Working directory looks like the previous commit
- ⚠️  Changes are GONE FOREVER!

**2. Reset to HEAD (educational - does nothing):**
\`git reset --hard HEAD\`
- Means "make my workspace look like HEAD"
- Since you're already at HEAD, nothing changes
- Good for understanding: HEAD = current position

**3. Destroy multiple commits:**
\`git reset --hard HEAD~4\`
- Goes back 4 commits
- All 4 commits are DELETED from history
- All changes in those commits are DELETED
- It's like they never existed! 👻

**When to Use --hard:**
- ✅ Experiment failed, throw it away
- ✅ Broke everything, need to start over
- ✅ Committed secrets/passwords by accident
- ❌ NOT on commits you've already pushed!
- ❌ NOT if you might need the changes later!

**Your Mission:**

**Step 1:** Destroy the last broken commit
\`git reset --hard HEAD~1\`
Check with \`git status\` - workspace is clean! 🧹

**Step 2:** Try resetting to HEAD (safe practice)
\`git reset --hard HEAD\`
Nothing happens - you're already there!

**Step 3:** Destroy multiple failed experiments
\`git reset --hard HEAD~3\`
All 3 bad commits are gone! It's like Friday never happened! 😅

**Remember:**
- 💥 This is the NUCLEAR OPTION
- 🗑️  Everything is deleted - commits AND changes
- ⏪ Can't be undone (unless you have the commit hash)
- 🎯 Only use when you're 100% sure
- ⚠️  NEVER use on pushed commits!

**Fun Fact:** Professional developers say "I'm going hard reset on this" when they want to start over completely! 🔥

        `🎯 **Advanced Reset: Using Commit Hashes**

**The Situation:**
Your project has grown. You're now at commit 8, but you need to go back to commit 3.

Using \`HEAD~5\` to count back 5 commits is annoying and error-prone. What if someone adds a commit while you're working? The count changes!

**The Professional Solution: Commit Hashes**

Every commit has a unique ID (hash), like a fingerprint:
\`a1b2c3d - "Version 2 - Good version"\`

This hash NEVER changes! It's permanent and unique.

**Current Situation:**
- Commit 8: "Attempted fix v3" - Still broken! 💔
- Commit 7: "Attempted fix v2" - Nope! 🐛
- Commit 6: "Attempted fix v1" - Failed! ❌
- Commit 5: "Add broken feature" - Started the mess 🔥
- Commit 4: "Update styling" - Cosmetic ✨
- Commit 3: "Version 2 - GOOD VERSION" - Last known good state! ✅
- Commit 2: "Version 1" - Initial version ✅
- Commit 1: "Initial commit" - Foundation ✅

**Your Mission:**

**Step 1: Find the Good Commit**
Run: \`git log --oneline\`

You'll see something like:
\`\`\`
f7e8a9b Attempted fix v3
d6c7b8a Attempted fix v2
c5b6a7f Attempted fix v1
b4a5c6e Add broken feature
a3b4c5d Update styling
9a2b3c4 Version 2 - Good version  ← THIS ONE!
8a1b2c3 Version 1
7a0b1c2 Initial commit
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Reset to That Commit**
\`git reset --soft 9a2b3c4\`
(Use the actual hash you see!)

OR (more destructive):
\`git reset --hard 9a2b3c4\`

**HEAD~n vs Commit Hash:**

**Relative (HEAD~n):**
- \`HEAD~1\` = "previous commit"
- \`HEAD~5\` = "5 commits ago"
- ❌ Changes if new commits are added
- ✅ Quick for recent commits

**Absolute (Commit Hash):**
- \`git reset --soft a1b2c3d\`
- ✅ Permanent reference
- ✅ Never changes
- ✅ Professional approach
- 🎯 Best for going back to specific known-good states

**Pro Tips:**
- Only need first 7 characters: \`9a2b3c4\` instead of full hash
- You can copy hashes from \`git log\`
- Hashes work with ANY git command: \`git show a1b2c3d\`
- Save important commit hashes in notes for easy rollback!

**Real-World Scenario:**
"Hey team, if the deploy breaks, rollback to commit 9a2b3c4 - that's our last stable version!"

**In CI/CD Systems:**
Production deploys often use commit hashes for precise version control:
\`\`\`
deploy.sh --commit=9a2b3c4
\`\`\`

"Remember," Sarah says, "we never commit directly to main. Always use feature branches, and make sure your commits tell a story."

**What's a Feature Branch?**
A feature branch is a separate branch where you develop a new feature in isolation. This allows you to:
- Work without affecting the stable main branch
- Get code reviewed before merging
- Easily abandon or modify work without impacting others

**The Complete Workflow:**
1. Create a feature branch from main: \`git switch -c feature/user-auth\`
2. Make changes to files and stage them with \`git add\`
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
4. Push your branch to remote: \`git push origin feature/user-auth\`
5. Switch back to main: \`git switch main\`
6. Merge the feature: \`git merge feature/user-auth\`

**What are Pull Requests (PRs)?**
In real teams, after step 4 (pushing your branch), you'd create a **Pull Request** on GitHub/GitLab instead of merging directly:

**Pull Request Workflow:**
1. You push your feature branch to the remote repository
2. On GitHub/GitLab, you open a Pull Request from \`feature/user-auth\` to \`main\`
3. Your teammates receive a notification
4. They review your code, leave comments, and suggest improvements
5. You make changes based on feedback and push again
6. Once approved, someone merges the PR into main
7. Your feature is now part of the main codebase!

**Why Pull Requests Matter:**
- **Code Quality**: Multiple eyes catch bugs and suggest improvements
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Team learns about changes before they go live
- **Documentation**: PR descriptions explain WHY changes were made
- **Discussion**: Complex decisions are discussed and recorded
- **Safety**: Prevents broken code from reaching production

In this level, we're simulating the workflow by having you push and merge directly to learn the Git commands. In real projects, you'd always use Pull Requests for team collaboration!`,

        `⚠️ Welcome to your first merge conflict!

**The Situation:**
You've been working on \`/src/auth/login.js\` this morning. You've improved the password validation to be stricter (minimum 5 chars for username, 10 for password). Great work!

But while you were coding, your teammate Sarah also pushed changes to the SAME FILE! She added email validation logic. Now you both have different versions of the same lines of code.

**Your Mission:**

**1. Check your local changes:** Run \`cat /src/auth/login.js\` to see YOUR improvements (already done, but not committed yet!)

**2. Commit YOUR changes first:**
\` git add /src/auth/login.js
git commit -m "Improve password validation requirements"
\`

**3. Now try to pull Sarah's changes:**
\` git pull origin main \`

**4. 💥 MERGE CONFLICT!** Git can't automatically merge because you and Sarah both modified the same lines! You'll see conflict markers in the file:
\`<<<<<<< HEAD
(your changes)
=======
(Sarah's changes)
>>>>>>> abc1234\`

**5. Resolve the conflict:**
- Edit \`/src/auth/login.js\` to combine the best of both versions
- Remove the conflict markers (\`<<<<<<<\`, \`=======\`, \`>>>>>>>\`)
- Keep both your stricter password length AND Sarah's email validation!

**6. Complete the merge:**
\`git add .
git commit -m "Merge Sarah's email validation with my password improvements"\`

**Pro Tip:** The best resolution often combines both changes! In this case, keep:
- Sarah's email validation logic (\`username.includes('@')\`)
- Your stricter length requirements (\`username.length >= 5\` and \`password.length >= 10\`)

This is completely normal in team development! Merge conflicts happen when multiple developers work on the same code. The key is resolving them thoughtfully.`,

But wait - at InnovateCorp, no code goes to production without a code review. It's not about trust - it's about quality, knowledge sharing, and catching bugs before customers see them.

**Why Code Reviews Matter:**
- **Quality:** Sarah might catch a security issue you missed
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Mike learns from your clever solution
- **Better Code:** Multiple perspectives make better software
- **Team Growth:** Everyone becomes a better developer

**Your Task:**
You need to prepare your password reset feature for team review. Follow the professional workflow:

**Step 1: Create a Feature Branch**
Never work directly on \`main\`! Create a dedicated branch for your feature.

**Step 2: Stage Your Work**
Add your completed files to the staging area.

**Step 3: Commit with a Clear Message**
Write a commit message that explains what you built. Your teammates should understand your changes without reading every line of code.

**Step 4: Push to Remote**
Upload your feature branch so your team can review it. In real teams, you'd then create a Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab.

**Remember:** The key to great code reviews is clear communication. Your branch name, commit messages, and code should tell a story!

        `⚡ You've been promoted to DevOps Engineer, and your first mission is to implement the "Quality Guardian" - an automated system that prevents bad code from entering the repository.

The development team has been growing rapidly, and with growth comes inconsistency:
- Commits without proper testing
- Code style violations
- Secrets accidentally committed
- Broken builds pushed to main

Your team lead, Sarah, explains the vision:

"We need automation to enforce our quality standards. Every commit should be automatically checked for:
- Linting and code style
- Unit test passage
- Security vulnerabilities
- Commit message standards"

"Git hooks are perfect for this. They're scripts that run at specific points in the Git workflow. Think of them as quality gates that code must pass through."

The hook ecosystem:
- pre-commit: Run checks before commits are created
- pre-push: Validate before pushing to remote
- post-commit: Send notifications or trigger builds
- Server-side hooks: Control what can be pushed

Your mission:
1. Implement a pre-commit hook for quality checks
2. Set up automated testing and linting
3. Create notification systems
4. Build a comprehensive quality pipeline

This is infrastructure work that will benefit every developer on your team. You're not just writing code - you're building the foundation for code quality.`,

    "mastery.level3.story.narrative":
        `🚨 BLACK FRIDAY, 2:00 AM - THE ULTIMATE TEST

You are the Senior DevOps Engineer at MegaCorp, and you're facing the perfect storm of Git challenges on the biggest shopping day of the year.

The situation:
- Production is partially broken due to a bad deployment
- Three different teams pushed hotfixes simultaneously
- The payment system is failing intermittently
- Customer support is overwhelmed
- The CEO is asking for hourly updates
- Black Friday traffic is 50x normal levels

Your CTO calls an emergency meeting:

"This is why we hired you. Everything we've built, everything we've learned, comes down to this moment. We need someone who can navigate complex Git operations under extreme pressure."

The challenge involves:
1. **Emergency Rollback**: Quickly revert the problematic deployment
2. **Selective Recovery**: Cherry-pick only the good changes
3. **Hotfix Coordination**: Merge critical fixes from multiple teams
4. **Release Management**: Create and deploy emergency patches
5. **Team Communication**: Coordinate across development, QA, and operations

You must use every Git technique in your arsenal:
- \`git rebase -i\` to clean up messy commits
- \`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>\` to select only working features (copies specific commits from one branch to another)
- Advanced merging with \`git merge\` to combine team efforts
- \`git bisect\` to find the exact problem commit (binary search through history to find bugs)
- \`git reflog\` to recover from mistakes
- \`git tag\` and branches for release management
- \`git mv <old> <new>\` to rename files while preserving Git history

**What is git cherry-pick?**
Cherry-picking allows you to copy specific commits from one branch to another. Instead of merging entire branches, you can pick and choose individual commits. Perfect for applying hotfixes from one branch to another!

Example: \`git cherry-pick abc123\` - applies commit abc123 to your current branch

**What is git bisect?**
Bisect helps you find which commit introduced a bug using binary search. Git will checkout commits for you to test, and you tell it "good" or "bad" until it finds the problematic commit.

Example:
\`git bisect start\`
\`git bisect bad\` (current commit is broken)
\`git bisect good abc123\` (this old commit worked)
Git will then guide you through testing commits until it finds the first bad one!

**What is git mv?**
Move or rename files while keeping Git history intact. Better than manually renaming files because Git tracks the rename.

Example: \`git mv old-name.js new-name.js\`

This isn't just about Git commands - it's about leadership, decision-making under pressure, and the ability to think systematically when everything is on fire.

The company's Black Friday revenue depends on you. Millions of customers are waiting. Your team is looking to you for guidance.

This is your moment. Show them what a Git Master can do.
